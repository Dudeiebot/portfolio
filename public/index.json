[{"content":"Credentials ðŸ”— Certificate ðŸ”— Credly Badge ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Video Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve passed the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam with just a month of preparation while pursuing MSc in Applied Computing at the University of Toronto and working as a DevOps Intern at 16Bit, a med-tech startup based in Toronto. In this article, Iâ€™ll be sharing everything about this exam, my preparation strategies and tips. So, if you have plans on taking this exam anytime soon, read this article till the end.\nWhat is AWS Developer - Associate Certification With the rise of Cloud Computing, companies have constantly been shifting from running their infrastructure on-premise, which is hard to scale and manage, to running them on cloud, which offers far more elasticity in terms of scaling and resiliency in case of disasters.\nThe AWS Developer - Associate certification validates your expertise in developing and maintaining applications on AWS, which is the leading cloud provider today. It focuses on AWS core services, development tools and deployment practices. It can help developers enhance their skills, increase their earning potential, and demonstrate their proficiency to potential employers.\nExam Format In this exam, you will get 65 questions and 130 minutes to answer them which means you get 2 mins per question. Out of the total questions, 15 will be experimental (ungraded). But you will not know which ones are experimental, otherwise you will skip them. So, you need to attempt every question on the test.\nYou will be graded on a percentile basis on a scale of 100 to 1000 where you will nead to score more than 720 to pass the exam. Based on this information, you can approximate that you will have to answer about 72% of the questions correctly in order to pass. You can refer this link for more details on how scoring works.\nThis exam has a pass / fail criteria. If you pass the exam, your score doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter. It will only be written on your score report for your reference. It will not be mentioned anywhere on the certificate.\nThe cost of taking this exam is 150 USD but I got 50% off, so I paid just 75 USD. The way it works is that if you passed your first AWS certification exam, then you can get 50% off on the second one if you take it within a year of taking the first certification. Since, I passed the AWS Solutionâ€™s Architect - Associate Certification exam in the month of May last year, I was eligible for the discount.\nMy Preparation Strategy I prepared for about 4-6 hours everyday for a months while being a grad student and working as a DevOps intern. I took the AWS Developer - Associate Course by Stephane Maarek which is available on Udemy. Preparing for the DVA exam was a bit easy for me as I had already passed the SAA exam, because the concepts overlap to some degree between the two certification exams.\nOnce I was done with the course, I bought three sets of practice tests on Udemy that are provided by:\nStephane Maarek Jon Bonso Neal Davis Each of these practice test packages contain 6 practice tests. Additionally, a free practice test is provided with the course.\nWhile going through the course, I took easy to follow notes in Notion. Additionally, while taking the practice tests, I saved the questions along with their explanations, into a Notion page, for the questions that I got wrong and the questions that I found difficult to answer. This would come in handy later when I revise everything before the exam.\nI also created a notion page for quick notes to include information thatâ€™s hard to remember, things like message retention duration of a Kinesis Data Stream or the IOPS limits for the different EBS volume types. I just glanced through this stuff before taking the actual test to have all that information fresh in my memory.\nðŸ”— My notes\nTaking the Test You can take the test either at a testing center or online at the comfort of your home. I would suggest you go for a testing center if it is available nearby. The experience is so smooth and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about internet connectivity or proctoring issues. I took the test at a testing center and my experience was good.\nLast year, I took the AWS SAA exam online from my home and my experience was pretty bad. The proctor asked me not to move my lips while reading the questions. So, the proctoring was way too strict. I was stressed and mindful about my body position, and was not able to focus well on the actual test. Another problem with taking the test online is that if the proctor cancels your exam, you won\u0026rsquo;t get a refund. You will have to rebook and retake the test at a later date.\nTips for taking the AWS SAA exam Take as many practice tests as you can. They will give you an idea of the kind of topics that come up in the exam most often. Also, the questions in these practice tests match very well with the ones appearing on the actual exam.\nThe amount of information that you will have to go through to prepare for this exam is enormous. You not only need a good understanding of the various AWS resources and architectures, but you will also have to remember a lot of information. So, keep at least 3 days to revise your notes before the exam.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all folks That was all about the AWS Developer - Associate Certification exam.

So, if you have plans on taking this exam anytime soon, read this article till the end.\nWhat is AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification With the rise of Cloud Computing, companies have constantly been shifting from running their infrastructure on-premise, to running them on cloud, which offers far more elasticity in terms of scaling and resiliency in case a disaster strikes.\nThe AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification validates your ability to design and deploy well-architected solutions on AWS, which is the leading cloud provider today. In simple terms, this exam tests your ability to propose an architecture given a specific scenario. For example: a company wants their application to continue running even if an entire AWS region, where that application was hosted, is down due to a disaster. So, how would you design their infrastructure around this use case?\nExam Format In this exam, you will get 65 questions and 130 minutes to answer them which means you get 2 mins per question. You will be graded on a percentile basis on a scale of 100 to 1000 where you will nead to score more than 720 to pass the exam.

It will only be written on your score report for your reference. It will not be mentioned anywhere on the certificate.\nThe cost of taking this exam is 150 USD and with taxes it comes up to about 177 USD. Since I took the exam in India, the amount for me was around 13,500 INR.\nMy Preparation Strategy I prepared for about 2 months while having a full-time job and simultaneously running my ðŸŽ¬ YouTube channel where I post resourceful videos every week. During these 2 months of preparatory period, I studied for about 2 hours on weekdays and 4-6 hours on weekends.\nFor preparation, I took the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Course by Stephane Maarek which is available on Udemy. While taking this course, I dumped all of the information available in the course into a Notion page.\nOnce I was done with the course, I bought three practice test packages for the AWS SAA exam on Udemy that are provided by:\nStephane Maarek Jon Bonso Neal Davis Each of these practice test packages contain 6 practice tests. Additionally, a free practice test is provided with the course.\nWhile taking the practice tests, I dumped the questions along with their explanations, into a Notion page, for the questions that I got wrong and the questions that I found difficult to answer. This would come in handy later when I revise everything before the exam.\nUntil now, everything was entangled in my head as I had not consumed information in an organized manner. So, I consolidated all of the information from the course and the practice tests into dense concise notes that, instead of Notion, I took on another note-taking app called Obsidian. Iâ€™ll explain why in another video. For the sake of the AWS exam, you can take your notes anywhere.\nIf you want my notes, you will have to wait for some time until I figure out a way to share my Obsidian notes in a presentable format. They cannot be directly shared like Notion pages.\nConsolidating my notes took about a week and while doing so I went through all of the information again but this time with a much more idea of the concepts. Everything started making sense and I felt confident to take the AWS SAA exam. So, I revised my consolidated notes once and took the exam the next day.\nTaking the Test You can either take the test offline at a testing center or online at the comfort of your home. I would suggest you take the test offline if you have testing centers in your area. If not, then you can take the online route. I had to take this test online as there are no testing centers nearby.\nDo keep in mind that the proctoring in the online test is extremely strict and if the proctor cancels your exam, you won\u0026rsquo;t get a refund. In such a scenario, you will have to rebook and retake the test at a later date.\nTips for taking the AWS SAA exam Take as many practice tests as you can.

You not only need a good understanding of the various AWS resources and architectures, but you will also have to remember a lot of information. So, filtering out the irrelevant details from the dumped information and making concise notes, that you can easily revise within 1 or 2 days is crucial for this exam.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all folks That was all about the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate exam. Up next, I have plans to take the AWS Developer Associate exam which focuses on the development aroud AWS services. As a personal milestone, I want to clear the AWS Developer Associate exam before I move to Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ for my MS.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/journal/aws-saa-certification/","summary":"Credentials ðŸ”— Certificate ðŸ”— Credly Badge ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Video Introduction I\u0026rsquo;ve passed the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate certification exam with just 2 months of preparation while working full-time as a software engineer.
