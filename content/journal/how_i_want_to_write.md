`Hey there, I'm Excel Ojo – a software engineer and cyber security reasearcher`  

`Throughout my illustrious career, I've been burdened with the 'opportunity' to toil endlessly on an exhaustive array of software projects spanning diverse domains and technologies. Should you dare to explore the vast expense of my endeavors, you'll find most of these 'masterpieces haunting my glorious`[`GitHub profile.`](https://github.com/Dudeiebot)

`As a self-proclaimed maestro of chaos, I take pride in crafting applications that dance precariously on the edge of functionality, ensuring they crash and burn across an eclectic mix of operating systems. In my coding circus, I dazzle spectators with the death-defying act of seamlessly switching between the beloved Vim for my editing escapades and, on occasion, delving into the realms of Rust, C, Python, and Java... you know, just to keep the thrill alive. But of course, who can resist the irresistible allure of Golang, perpetually beckoning me from dawn till dusk?`

`Switching between languages? Piece of cake! With my uncanny knack for clear task understanding, I glide through coding multiverses like a seasoned cosmic traveler. Along the way, I've wrestled with all sorts of databases – from the relational realms of MySQL and PostgreSQL to the NoSQL wonderlands of MongoDB, and even the mystical domains of in-memory databases like Redis. It's a coding carnival, and I'm the ringmaster.`

`Ah, when it comes to constructing large systems with more moving parts than a circus, having a crystal-clear grasp of the architecture is absolutely key. We're talking about laying the groundwork for something that'll stand the test of time, like a skyscraper made of code!`

`Now, me? I'm all about the microservices life for handling these behemoths. It's like having an army of tiny, fault-tolerant soldiers ready to leap into action at a moment's notice. And let's not forget about scalability – I design my architecture to sprawl horizontally like a sprawling metropolis, making sure load balancing and caching are as smooth as silk for juggling all that traffic and data. It's a bit like being the master conductor of a chaotic symphony – and trust me, I've got the baton!"`

`Ah, for the upkeep of these mammoth systems, I'm all about preaching the gospel of clear and concise code. It's like having a well-lit roadmap in the dark alleys of programming – you want your fellow coders to easily find their way, don't you?`

`And let's not forget about the holy scripture of documentation! I'm talking about laying down the law with comprehensive guides that break down the system architecture like it's storytime. Not only does it help teammembers find their feet in this crazy code jungle, but it also acts as a trusty troubleshooter for when things inevitably go haywire. It's like having a GPS for your code – and trust me, we're all gonna need it at some point`


`I've had the opportunity to build microservices architecture, backend services, DevOps workflows, and command-line utilities with Go, and my experience with them has been exceptional. From handling concurrency and scalability to achieving high throughput performance and ensuring readability, Go has consistently delivered outstanding results.`

`Most of my personal projects are written in Go. For instance, there is a mmorpg game that I play every day, where I utilize Go to concurrently delete items with 0 durability when they become abundant. I've also shared this tool with others, as they find it beneficial for their needs. The joy lies in being able to wake up and effortlessly write code for something I envision, and seeing it work seamlessly`

`Additionally, I've worked on other projects with Go, all of which have been successful and are running smoothly.`

`Ah, Python – it's been quite the rollercoaster ride! While our relationship may have its ups and downs, there's no denying the sheer power and versatility of this language. Despite the occasional bumps in the road, I find myself drawn back to Python time and time again.`

`During my final year project at Uni, Python became my trusty companion as I delved into the realm of deepfakes, crafting models to distinguish fact from fiction in the digital realm. And let's not forget its role in data analysis and visualization – seems like Python's fingerprints are everywhere!`

`But it didn't stop there – Python even helped me build a stock exchange app using Django. Yet, like any relationship, we've had our disagreements. One recurring headache was the constant updating of the requirements.txt file due to package updates, leading to a never-ending cycle of installations and updates. But hey, all's fair in love and coding, right?`

`My proudest moments as an engineer are like little victories that happen all the time. There's nothing quite like the feeling of seeing my solutions come to life and being appreciated by others. One memory that stands out is when I crafted a script for a game – the excitement from the gamers in the Discord channel was contagious, and their joy was infectious.`

`I thrive on tackling challenges head-on, leaving no stone unturned until I find the perfect solution. Persistence is my middle name, and I've yet to meet a problem that I couldn't crack with a little bit of determination and a whole lot of elbow grease. It's these moments of triumph that remind me why I love what I do – making a tangible difference in people's lives, one problem at a time.`
