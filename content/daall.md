Hey there, I'm Excel Ojo â€“ a software engineer and cybersecurity researcher.
Throughout my career, I've worked on various software projects spanning diverse domains and technologies, most of which are available on my [`GitHub profile.`](https://github.com/Dudeiebot)

I hold a degree in cybersecurity, encompassing coursework in mathematics, software engineering, cryptography, and related fields. This educational background has equipped me with a robust foundation in both theoretical principles and hands-on applications.

In particular, I have dedicated my time to mastering Golang, alongside increasing proficiency in Rust, C, Java, Javascript and Python. Leveraging Go extensively, I have contributed to the development of microservices, backend services, DevOps workflows, and command-line utilities.  

My most cool experience as an engineer derive from successfully deploying solutions that resonate with users. I am committed to tackling challenges with tenacity, endeavoring to enact meaningful change in individuals' lives through incremental problem-solving.

In my leisure time, I dedicate myself to refining my problem-solving abilities by engaging with LeetCode challenges. Additionally, I occasionally enjoy exploring virtual environments within video games as a means of relaxation.
