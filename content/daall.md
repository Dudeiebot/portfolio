Hey there, Excel Ojo here â€“ a software engineer/software security engineer.
The majority of the software projects I've worked on over my career, which cover a variety of industries and technologies, are accessible through my[`GitHub profile.`](https://github.com/Dudeiebot)

I hold a degree in cybersecurity, which includes courses in algorithms, cryptography, software engineering, design model and related fields. This educational background has equipped me with a robust foundation in both theoretical principles and hands-on applications.

In particular, I have dedicated my time to mastering Golang, in addition becoming proficient and learning in Rust, C, Java, Javascript and Python. Leveraging Go extensively, I have contributed to the creation of microservices, backend services, DevOps workflows, and command-line utilities.  

My most exciting engineering experience has been effectively delivering user-friendly solutions. I am dedicated to confronting issues with perseverance, hoping to effect genuine change in people's lives through incremental problem-solving.
In my free time, I practise problem-solving skills by participating in LeetCode challenges. I also enjoy exploring virtual environment within video games as a kind of relaxation.
